About me

Hello! My name is Sora, and I'm a Software Engineer ☺. 

I have an educational background in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I have about 2 years of professional
experience in software engineering, particularly in network and automation engineering, but I'm open to anything!

Having experience in working at a startup, I am comfortable with working in fast paced environments, taking on new projects, 
and learning new skills.
I possess articulate and professional communication skills, a productive and competent mindset in team-based and self-managed projects, 
and dedication to delivering efficient, scalable, and user-friendly products and solutions.
